## 🌱 About Me 
Currently I'm in first semester, pursuing my BCA (Distance) from Manipal University Jaipur. I’m on an exciting journey into Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning, documenting my progress and sharing what I learn along the way.

## 💡 What drives me:

- Turning raw data into insights that solve real-world problems
- Exploring Machine Learning & AI models that can predict, recommend, and adapt
- Understanding how technology can analyze not just numbers, but also human behavior & emotions
- Growing through collaboration with learners and professionals in this space

## 📌 Current focus:

- Advancing Python skills (beyond basics → applied coding for DS/ML)
- Learning ML concepts like preprocessing, normalization, and simple models
- Building hands-on projects and documenting them on GitHub & Kaggle
- Strengthening foundations in SQL and math for data science

## 🌱 Why I share my journey:
I believe growth compounds when we learn in public. My posts are not just updates, but also invitations for collaboration, discussions, and feedback.

## 🎯 Long-term goal:
To become a Data Scientist or AI Engineer at a leading tech company, where I can contribute to innovative projects that leverage data for real-world impact.
